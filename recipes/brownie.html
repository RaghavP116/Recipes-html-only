        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brownies are pastries with a dense texture and a chocolate flavour. Traditionally, brownies are served in small square-shaped pieces. Brownies often contain ingredients such as nuts or other ingredients that give them a special flavour to take the edge off the full chocolate taste.</p>
