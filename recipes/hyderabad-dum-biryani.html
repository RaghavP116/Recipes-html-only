        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hyderabadi Dum Biryani is a flavorful Indian rice dish where marinated meat (usually goat or chicken) is layered with fragrant basmati rice and slow-cooked in a sealed pot, allowing the flavors to meld together through steam. This "dum" cooking method creates a rich, aromatic, and tender biryani. </p>
        <p>The "dum" method, which involves sealing the pot to cook the ingredients in their own steam, is key to its unique taste. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basmati rice</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Whole Spices( Bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, and black cumin)</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Yogurt</li>
            <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>Red chili powder</li>
            <li>Turmeric powder</li>
            <li>coriander powder</li>
            <li>Biryani Masala</li>
            <li>Fried Onions</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li>Green chilies</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl, mix thoroughly to coat the chicken, and let marinate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight in the refrigerator for maximum tenderness and flavor. </li>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan, fry the onions until golden brown and crispy, then remove and set aside. Some of this fried onion will be used for marinating the chicken and the rest for layering. You can also use store-bought fried onions. </li>
            <li> Rinse the rice until the water runs clear and soak for 30 minutes. In a separate large pot, bring water to a boil, add whole spices, salt, and oil. Once boiling, add the soaked and drained rice. Cook until the rice is about 75% done (al dente, still firm to the bite). Drain the rice and set aside. </li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot (or Dutch oven) layer the marinated chicken at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the par-cooked rice over the chicken</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with fried onions, fresh mint and coriander leaves, and saffron milk or rose/kewra water.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers if you have enough ingredients, or simply top with the remaining rice, fried onions, herbs, and saffron milk/kewra water.</li>
            <li>You can also add a dollop of ghee on top for richness and flavor. </li>
            <li>Dough Seal: Seal the pot with a thick, moist dough around the rim and the lid. This traps the steam and flavors.</li>
        </ol>
